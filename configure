# Link parts of the Cygwin binary statically to aid in redistribution?  The
# binary still links dynamically against the main DLL.  The MinGW binaries are
# also statically linked and therefore depend only on Windows DLLs.  I started
# linking the Cygwin/MSYS binary statically, because G++ 4.7 changed the
# Windows C++ ABI.
